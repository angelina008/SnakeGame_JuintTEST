# SnakeGame_JuintTEST
The code for the game isn't mine, I found it on this link on this platform :  https://github.com/hexadeciman/Snake
I wrote the tests, and added some lines in the main code, because I needed it, but I have added comments so it can be distinguished what lines are added by me. 
This code is for University project.
